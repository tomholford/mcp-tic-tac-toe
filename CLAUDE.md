## Concept

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to build a simple Tic Tac Toe game where the AI opponent is powered by a language model. The game will be implemented in Go and will utilize MCP to interact with the language model for making moves.

## Features

- Simple command-line interface for playing Tic Tac Toe.
- AI opponent powered by a language model using MCP.
- Basic game logic for Tic Tac Toe.
- Ability to reset the game and play multiple rounds.
- Display the game board after each move.
- Announce the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

## Guidance

Break down complex servers into smaller pieces
Document your code well for future maintenance
Follow MCP protocol specifications carefully
